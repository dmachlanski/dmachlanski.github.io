Hello World, it’s Damian!

This is the first blogpost and I’m very excited to finally launch this website.

I was struggling for a while to choose a place suitable for me. I wanted something very simple so I could just focus on writing rather than wasting my time and energy on setting up plugins, databases, a hosting etc. I tried [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) hosted on [WPEngine](https://wpengine.co.uk/) a year ago and it was too much of a hassle in my opinion. I felt like I was doing everything but writing and decided to give up.

After that, I started considering [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) and [Medium](https://medium.com/) but they didn’t felt quite right either.

Then finally, I came across [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and became curious how it works. I went through example websites, read about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and all looked very promising. It had everything I was looking for: no databases, simple static content but hugely flexible if you’re ready to spend some time on it, free and reliable hosting and the most important factor – you can start over in no time.

I must admit I was slightly scared that such flexibility can make it difficult to maintain due to possible increased complexity. Fortunately, I was wrong and gave it a try :)

Of course, it wouldn’t be so easy, if there was no so many great existing websites with public source code and tutorials. Personally, I found [this guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) hugely helpful – it was my starting point. I think it comprises all the necessary resources and external links to get started quickly and effectively so nothing to add from my side (I don’t want to duplicate existing content).

So yes, that’s my short story and I’m happy how it ended so far.

You can find your place too! :)
