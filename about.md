Hi! I’m Damian and this is my blog. Welcome!

I’m a Software Developer on daily basis, .NET technologies more specifically. I’ve been working on Xamarin project lately, which is really fun to do.

However, this blog is meant to focus solely on AI area, which I’m trying to learn more about. And hence this website – to publish some of my write-ups while I study this topic along the way.

This isn’t supposed to be a regular blogging for sure but rather occasional reports of my studies and projects. Nevertheless, I hope someone finds it useful.

Feel free to catch up with me on social media or drop me an email.

Thanks for coming by!
