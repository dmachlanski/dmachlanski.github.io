# Interests
My primary research interests are Causality and Machine Learning (ML), with an emphasis on using modern ML methods to solve causal problems. More specific areas of interest are as follows.

## Causality
- Treatment Effect Estimation
- Structure Learning / Causal Discovery
- Observational Data
- Cross-sectional and Panel Data
- Treatment Recommendation / Policy Learning

## Machine Learning
- Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection
- Performance Evaluation
- Data and Covariate Shifts
- OOD Generalisation

## Research Software Engineering
I am also interested in Software Engineering for Research purposes, which nicely fits into my software development background. Some of the topics and themes that particularly interest me are:
- Backend Development
- Benchmarking
- Reproducibility
- Performance Engineering
